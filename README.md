This progam using to redu internet traffic by using "SOM" algoritim, using Data-set that contain huge data.
We using Data Set UNSW-NB15 file name is training.csv and the file tcp.csv is only tcp traffic from UNSW-NB15
there is 6 code for training SOM model every code using different features
1-6_76.ipynb this code using all protocols with 6 features, for label used 43 number features.
2-6_92_0&1.ipynb this code using all protocols with 6 features, for label used 44 number features.
3-13_80_cat.ipynb this code using tcp protocols with 13 features, for label used 44 number features.
4-13_80_0&1.ipynb this code using tcp protocols with 13 features, for label used 43 number features.
5-Project-Ali3.ipynb this code using tcp protocols with 35 features, for label used 44 number features.
6-Copy_of_Project3.ipynb this code using tcp protocols with 35 features, for label used 44 number features and prediction part.
